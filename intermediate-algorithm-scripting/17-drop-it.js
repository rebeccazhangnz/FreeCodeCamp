/* Intermediate Algorithm: Drop It

Drop the elements of an array (first argument), starting from the front, until 
the predicate (second argument) returns true.

The second argument, func, is a function you'll use to test the first elements 
of the array to decide if you should drop it or not.

Return the rest of the array, otherwise return an empty array.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.
